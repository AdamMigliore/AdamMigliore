## Projects
### 2023 | Weight Tracker Tool | Health and Fitness | [Repository](https://github.com/AdamMigliore/weight-analysis)
This project is used by myself daily to track my weight. I created visualizations using [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) for my weight, body fat and calories data. I also have a chart for the median week-to-week weight fluctuation which is better suited to view weight change directions over time. Finally, I implemented my own algorithm to estimate my average caloric intake based on the data I gathered. This project is a hosted locally on a Ubuntu server.

### 2022-2023 | Urbengage | Capstone Design Project
This project was a research project done under the advisor of Prof. Nik Luka from [Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecure](https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). Our team researched the components which facilitate urban planners in gathering citizen feedback on urban initiatives. We successfully proved that our solution could help urban planners reduce 10x their costs and save them 200+ manhours. We created an engaging surveying experience for citizens, we automated data analysis and visualization and we optimized mobilization campaigns. This project was a success all while coming under a third of the allocated budget.
